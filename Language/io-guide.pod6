=head1 The Wrong Way To Do Things

This section describes how NOT to do Perl 6 IO.

=head2 Leave $*SPEC Alone

You may have heard of L«C<$*SPEC>|/language/variables#Dynamic_variables» and
seen some code or books show its usage for splitting and joining path fragments.
Some of the routine names it provides may even look familiar to what you've
used in other languages.

However, unless you're writing your own IO framework,
you don't ever need to use L«C<$*SPEC>|/language/variables#Dynamic_variables»!
L«C<$*SPEC>|/language/variables#Dynamic_variables» provides low-level stuff and
its use will not only make your code horrible to read, you'll likely introduce
security issues (e.g. null characters)!

The L«C<IO::Path>|/type/IO::Path» type is the workhorse of Perl 6 world. It
caters to all the path manipulation needs as well as provides shortcut routines
that let you avoid dealing with file handles. Use that instead of the
L«C<$*SPEC>|/language/variables#Dynamic_variables» stuff.

Tip: you can join path parts with C</> and feed them to
L«C<IO::Path>|/type/IO::Path»'s routines; they'll still do The Right Thing™ with
them, regardless of the operating system.

=for code :skip-test
# WRONG!! TOO MUCH WORK!
my $fh = open $*SPEC.catpath: '', 'foo/bar', $file;
my $data = $fh.slurp;
$fh.close;

# RIGHT! Use IO::Path to do all the dirty work
my $data = 'foo/bar'.IO.add($file).slurp;

=head2 Stringifying IO::Path

Don't use C<.Str> method to stringify L«C<IO::Path>|/type/IO::Path» objects,
unless you just want to display them somewhere for information purposes or
something. The C<.Str> method returns whatever the basic path string the
L«C<IO::Path>|/type/IO::Path» was instantiated with. It doesn't consider the
value of L«C<$.CWD> attribute|/type/IO::Path#attribute_CWD». For example, this
code is broken:

=for code :skip-test
# WRONG!! .Str DOES NOT USE $.CWD!
my $path = 'foo'.IO;
chdir 'bar';
run <tar -cvvf archive.tar>, ~$path;

The L«C<chdir>|/routine/chdir» call changed the value of the current directory,
but the C<$path> we created is relative to the directory before that change.

However, the L«C<IO::Path>|/type/IO::Path» object I<does> know what directory
it's relative to. We just need to use L«C<.absolute>|/routine/absolute» or
L«C<.relative>|/routine/relative» to stringify the object. Both routines return
a L«C<Str>|/type/Str» object; they only differ in whether the result is an
absolute or relative path. So, we can fix our code like this:

=for code :skip-test
# RIGHT!! .absolute does consider the value of $.CWD!
my $path = 'foo'.IO;
chdir 'bar';
run <tar -cvvf archive.tar>, $path.absolute;
# Also good:
run <tar -cvvf archive.tar>, $path.relative;

=head2 Be mindful of $*CWD

While usually out of view, every L«C<IO::Path>|/type/IO::Path» object, by
default, uses the current value of
L«C<$*CWD>|/language/variables#Dynamic_variables» to set its
L«C<$.CWD> attribute|/type/IO::Path#attribute_CWD». This means there are two
things to pay attention to.

=head3 temp the $*CWD

This code is a mistake:

=for code :skip-test
# WRONG!!
my $*CWD = "foo".IO;

The C<my $*CWD> made L«C<$*CWD>|/language/variables#Dynamic_variables»
undefined. The L«C<.IO>|/routine/IO» coercer
then goes ahead and sets the L«C<$.CWD> attribute|/type/IO::Path#attribute_CWD»
of the path its creating to the stringified version of the undefined C<$*CWD>;
an empty string.

The correct way to perform this operation is use
L«C<temp>|/routine/temp» instead of C<my>. It'll localize the effect of changes
to L«C<$*CWD>|/language/variables#Dynamic_variables», just like C<my> would,
but it won't make it undefined, so the L«C<.IO>|/routine/IO» coercer will still
get the correct old value:

=for code :skip-test
temp $*CWD = "foo".IO;

Better yet, if you want to perform some code in localized
L«C<$*CWD>|/language/variables#Dynamic_variables», use the
L«C<indir> routine|/routine/indir» for that purpose.
