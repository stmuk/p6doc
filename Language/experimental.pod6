=TITLE Experimental Features

=SUBTITLE New features for brave users

During Perl 6 development, new features are often made available for
users to experimental with before their design is completed. Eventually
these features may be made part of the Perl 6 specification.  To use these
features, one uses the C<experimental> pragma in program source code, for
example, like this:

=begin code
use experimental :macros;
=end code

Following is a list of current experimental features and a short
description of each feature's purpose or a link to more details about
its use.  (Note: Features marked marked "[TBD]" are to be defined
later.)

=comment The following should be a table but formatting in tables is
not yet rendered properly.

=item X<B<cache>|cache> [TBD]

=item X<B<macros>|macros> [TBD]

=item X<B<pack>|pack> [TBD]

=end pod
