=TITLE Unicode versus Texas symbols

=SUBTITLE Unicode symbols and their Texas (ASCII) counterparts

The following unicode symbols can be used in Perl 6 without needing to load
any additional modules.  Please note that the Since column applies to the
version of Perl the symbol was known to be available.  It is only mentioned
if it is different from C<6.c>.

Please note that any codepoints that have the C<Ll> or C<Lu> property,
can be used just like any other alphabetic character.  Also, any codepoint
that has the L<Nd> property, can be used as a digit in any number.
