=TITLE class Date

=SUBTITLE Calendar date

    class Date { }

A C<Date> is an immutable object identifying a day in the Gregorian calendar.

Date objects support addition and subtraction of integers, where an
integer is interpreted as the number of days. You can compare Date objects
with the numeric comparison operators C<< ==, <, <=, >, >=, != >>.
Their stringification in C<YYYY-MM-DD> format means that comparing them
with the string operators C<eq, lt, le> etc. also gives the right result.

C<Date.today> creates
an object the current day according to the system clock.

    my $d = Date.new(2015, 12, 24); # Christmas Eve!
    say $d;                         # 2015-12-24
    say $d.year;                    # 2015
    say $d.month;                   # 12
    say $d.day;                     # 24
    say $d.day-of-week;             # 1  (that's Monday)
    my $n = Date.new('2015-12-31'); # New Year's Eve
    say $n - $d;                    # 7 days between New Years/Christmas Eve
    say $n + 1;                     # 2016-01-01

=head1 Methods

=head2 method new

Defined as:

    proto method new() {*}
    multi method new($year, $month, $day)             returns Date:D
    multi method new(:$year!, :$month = 1, :$day = 1) returns Date:D
    multi method new(Str $date)                       returns Date:D
    multi method new(Instant:D $dt)                   returns Date:D
    multi method new(DateTime:D $dt)                  returns Date:D

Usage:

    $date = Date.new(YEAR, MONTH, DAY)
    $date = Date.new(year => YEAR, month => MONTH?, day => DAY?)
    $date = Date.new(YYYY-MM-DD)
    $date = Date.new(now)
    $date = Date.new(DateTime.now)

Creates a new C<Date> object, either from a triple of (year, month, day)
that can be coerced to integers, or from a string of the form C<YYYY-MM-DD>
(L<ISO 8601|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601>), or from an Instant
