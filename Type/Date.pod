=TITLE class Date

=SUBTITLE Calendar date

    class Date { }

A C<Date> is an immutable object identifying a day in the Gregorian calendar.

Date objects support addition and subtraction of integers, where an
integer is interpreted as the number of days. You can compare Date objects
with the numeric comparison operators C<< ==, <, <=, >, >=, != >>.
Their stringification in C<YYYY-MM-DD> format means that comparing them
with the string operators C<eq, lt, le> etc. also gives the right result.

C<Date.today> creates
an object the current day according to the system clock.

    my $d = Date.new(2012, 12, 24); # Christmas Eve!
    say $d;                         # 2012-12-24
    say $d.year;                    # 2012
    say $d.month;                   # 12
    say $d.day;                     # 24
    say $d.day-of-week;             # 1  (that's Monday)
    my $n = Date.new('2012-12-31'); # New Year's Eve
    say $n - $d;                    # 7
    say $n + 1;                     # 2013-01-01
