=head2 method kxxv

Defined as:

    method kxxv(Baggy:D:) returns List:D

Returns a list of the keys of the invocant, with each key multiplied by its
weight. Note that C<kxxv> only works for C<Baggy> types which have integer
weights, i.e. L<Bag> and L<BagHash>.

    my $breakfast = bag <spam eggs spam spam bacon>;
    say $breakfast.kxxv.sort;                         # (bacon eggs spam spam spam)

    my $n = ("a" => 0, "b" => 1, "b" => 2).BagHash;
    say $n.kxxv;                                      # (b b b)
