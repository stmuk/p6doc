=head2 method keys

Defined as:

    method keys(Baggy:D:) returns List:D

Returns a list of all keys in the C<Baggy> object without taking
their individual weights into account as opposed to L<kxxv|#method kxxv>.

    my $breakfast = bag <eggs spam spam spam>;
    say $breakfast.keys.sort;                        # (eggs spam)

    my $n = ("a" => 5, "b" => 2).BagHash;
    say $n.keys.sort;                                # (a b)

=head2 method kxxv

Defined as:

    method kxxv(Baggy:D:) returns List:D

Returns a list of the keys of the invocant, with each key multiplied by its
weight. Note that C<kxxv> only works for C<Baggy> types which have integer
weights, i.e. L<Bag> and L<BagHash>.

    my $breakfast = bag <spam eggs spam spam bacon>;
    say $breakfast.kxxv.sort;                         # (bacon eggs spam spam spam)

    my $n = ("a" => 0, "b" => 1, "b" => 2).BagHash;
    say $n.kxxv;                                      # (b b b)

=head2 method elems

Defined as:

    method elems(Baggy:D:) returns Int:D

Returns the number of elements in the C<Baggy> object without
taking the individual elements weight into account.

    my $breakfast = bag <eggs spam spam spam>;
    say $breakfast.elems;                             # 2

    my $n = ("b" => 9.4, "b" => 2).MixHash;
    say $n.elems;                                     # 1
