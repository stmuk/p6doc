=TITLE class Method

=SUBTITLE Member function

    class Method is Routine { }

A type for methods. To create a method outside a L<class
definition|/language/typesystem#Methods>, use the declarators C<my> and C<method>:

    my $m = method ($invocant: $param) {
        say "$invocant: '$param'";
    }
    "greeting".$m("hello");         # greeting: 'hello'

    <a b c>.&(my method (List:D:){dd self; self}).say;
    # OUTPUT«("a", "b", "c")␤(a b c)␤»

Methods will ignore extra named arguments where other types of C<Routine> will
throw at runtime.

    my method foo(){};
    my $c;
    $c.&foo(:answer(42));
    # ( no output )
